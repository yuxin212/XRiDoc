In Editor, users can play with six 360 videos simultaneously. All these 360 videos are compressed in advance to avoid performance problems. The main function of the Editor is to add annotations on these videos and edit those annotations. Also, the Editor is capable of controlling these 360 videos either separately or simultaneously. 

Annotation
==========

On the right side of the page, there is a toolbar containing dozens of buttons. These buttons are used for adding annotations, editing annotations, and controlling 360 videos. This part will introduce and describe how annotations are added and edited. 

Add annotation

After videos have been loaded, you need to first select one canvas using `Select Active Canvas` button to enter the select canvas mode, and clicking on the video canvas you want to add an annotation. After selecting one canvas, the selected canvas name will be displayed in the middle of toolbar, and you may want to click the `Select Active Canvas` button again to prevent this select canvas mode from obstructing you to do the next things. 

There are six kind of annotations provided: text annotation, button annotation, comment annotation, flag annotation, exclamation annotation, and favorite annotation. 

**Due to some technical problems, text annotation is now disabled. **

After adding one annotation, there will be no active canvas, and there will displaying N/A in the middle of toolbar. If you want to add another annotation either on the previous video canvas or on other video canvas, you need to follow the previous instruction to select active canvas again and add annotation.
